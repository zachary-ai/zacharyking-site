        <p>You're running every deal. Coaching every rep. Answering every question about pricing, positioning, and objections.</p>
        <p class="text-3xl font-semibold" style="color: var(--color-text-primary);">Nothing happens without you in the room.</p>
        <p>Reps can't close without you. New hires take months to ramp. Your CRM is a mess. You can't forecast. You can't take a vacation without deals stalling.</p>

        <p class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold mt-12 gradient-text" style="font-family: 'DM Sans', sans-serif;">
          You've built a sales process that only works when you're the one running it.
