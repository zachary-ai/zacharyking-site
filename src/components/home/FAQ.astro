  {
    question: "What is a fractional GTM leader?",
    answer: "A fractional GTM leader is an experienced go-to-market executive who embeds with your team part-time (typically 1-3 days per week) to build and execute your sales strategy. Unlike consultants who give advice and leave, I act as your internal GTM leader - building strategy, creating playbooks, implementing systems, coaching your team, and running live deals. You get senior leadership without the full-time exec cost or hiring risk."
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from a sales consultant?",
    answer: "Sales consultants typically audit your process, give recommendations, and hand you a deck. I embed as part of your leadership team and do the work: I build your GTM strategy, write your sales playbook (15-25K words), implement AI infrastructure on your platforms, train your team, and support active deals. Everything I build stays with you and your team operates it independently after the engagement. You're paying for systems that stay, not advice that fades."
  },
  {
    question: "What if we already have a sales playbook?",
    answer: "Perfect. I'll audit what you have, identify gaps, and enhance it. Most early-stage playbooks are good on paper but weak on execution details - missing objection handling, qualification frameworks, discovery questions, or deal strategy templates. I'll also modernize it with AI-powered components like automated research, signal detection, and intelligent follow-up sequences. If your playbook is genuinely complete and working, we'll focus on AI deployment and team enablement instead."
  },
  {
    question: "What AI platforms do you support?",
    answer: "I'm platform-agnostic and build on whatever you already use. Most clients use Microsoft 365 (Copilot Studio), Anthropic Claude (with MCP integrations), or OpenAI (GPT-4 + Assistants API). I can also deploy on Salesforce Einstein, HubSpot AI, or custom LLM stacks. The goal is to build AI infrastructure on YOUR platforms - not create vendor lock-in or force platform switches."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need Claude/Microsoft/a specific tool to work with you?",
    answer: "No. I adapt to your existing tech stack. If you have Microsoft 365, we'll build there. If you use Google Workspace and Claude, we'll build there. If you have a custom AI setup, we'll work with that. My job is to make AI work within your environment, not force you onto new platforms. Most engagements start with what you already have and only add tools if there's a clear gap."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my team doesn't use AI yet?",
    answer: "That's common and totally fine. We start with GTM foundations first - ICP, messaging, sales process, playbook. Then I introduce AI gradually where it creates the most leverage: prospect research, email personalization, CRM automation, signal detection. I train your team as we deploy, so they understand how to use the tools and why they work. The AI enhances your GTM system, it doesn't replace good fundamentals."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to deploy the AI agents?",
    answer: "Depends on scope and complexity, but typical timelines: <strong>Simple automations (CRM workflows, email sequences):</strong> 1-2 weeks. <strong>Conversational agents (prospect research, deal strategy):</strong> 2-4 weeks. <strong>Full GTM Swarm (6 specialized agents):</strong> 90 days including playbook, integrations, testing, and training. I prioritize fast deployment of the highest-impact agents first, then iterate and expand based on what's actually working."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after the engagement ends?",
    answer: "You keep everything. The strategy, playbook, AI agents, workflows, templates, CRM setup - it's all yours. Your team operates the systems independently because I train them throughout the engagement, not just at the end. Many clients opt for the Swarm Subscription ($1.2K/month) for ongoing support, quarterly playbook updates, and access to new agent features, but it's optional. You're never locked in."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with enterprise security requirements?",
    answer: "Yes. I work within your security policies and compliance requirements. All AI deployments respect your data governance, access controls, and security protocols. For regulated industries (finance, healthcare), I can deploy agents on private cloud or on-premise infrastructure. I sign NDAs as standard, and for enterprise clients I'm happy to go through vendor onboarding and security reviews."
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from Gong, Clari, or other AI sales tools?",
    answer: "Those are excellent point solutions for specific problems (call recording, forecasting, conversation intelligence). I build the broader GTM system that makes those tools valuable. Most early-stage companies aren't ready for enterprise sales tools - they need strategy, process, and playbook first. I build that foundation, then deploy AI on your platforms (Microsoft, Claude, Salesforce) to automate research, personalization, and workflows. If you already use Gong or Clari, great - I'll integrate with them."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the ROI and expected results?",
    answer: "Depends on your stage, but typical outcomes after 90 days: <strong>Repeatable pipeline generation</strong> (founders no longer bottleneck sales), <strong>50-70% reduction in manual research time</strong> (AI handles prospect research, email drafting, CRM updates), <strong>Improved close rates</strong> (better qualification, objection handling, deal strategy), and <strong>Team readiness to scale</strong> (documented playbook, trained team, working systems). Most clients recoup the investment within 2-3 closed deals, but the real value is having a GTM system that compounds over time."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you do permanent hires or just fractional?",
    answer: "Just fractional. I'm not looking for full-time VP roles. The fractional model works because I can embed deeply with 2-4 clients simultaneously, bringing cross-company insights and avoiding the politics of full-time roles. If you need a permanent GTM leader after our engagement, I'm happy to help you hire and onboard someone (and they'll inherit a working playbook and AI infrastructure). But my focus is building systems that reduce your dependency on expensive full-time execs, not becoming one myself."
