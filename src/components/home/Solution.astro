        I build your GTM strategy — ICP, positioning, segmentation, channels. The foundational work most startups skip.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I create the playbook — your sales process, messaging frameworks, objection handling, discovery questions, competitive positioning, email sequences. The actual words your team needs to win deals.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I deploy it as an AI swarm — six specialized agents trained on YOUR playbook that your team can access 24/7.

          The strategy becomes a playbook. The playbook becomes a system. The system scales without you hiring.
