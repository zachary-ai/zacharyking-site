      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
        <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I've spent 20+ years in B2B sales — from early-stage startups to running Asia for a $900M adtech company. I've launched markets, built teams, and closed enterprise deals across three continents.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Now I work exclusively with startups building AI-native GTM systems.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Not just strategy decks. Not just playbooks. Actual systems that run on AI and keep working after I leave.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I'm deep in the weeds with Claude, automations, and agent workflows. I use AI daily in my own work and I build it into everything I deliver to clients.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 my-8">
          <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
            If your GTM isn't leveraging AI yet, you're already behind.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I work with product-obsessed founders who want sales without killing the founder vibe. Startups who've proven the product works and now need to structure growth without hiring a full-time VP Sales.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8">
          If that sounds like you, let's talk.
