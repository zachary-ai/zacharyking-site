As a [fractional VP of Sales](/insights/what-is-a-fractional-vp-sales/), I have engaged with 15+ companies in the last two years, all operating fully remote. The transition to remote leadership requires rapid integration into existing teams and leadership structures. This experience has revealed both successful and challenging aspects of distributed work environments.

## The Golden Rules of Nailing Remote Work

**Async is King:**

Employees can contribute at times that suit their personal productivity peaks and life commitments, reducing the need for real-time meetings. Asynchronous video tools like Loom serve as game-changers, enabling updates to be shared without extensive calendar coordination. Defaulting to async eliminates many routine check-in meetings.

**Documentation is Your New Best Friend:**

Comprehensive documentation forms the organizational backbone, allowing team members to access information independently. This reduces reliance on synchronous communication for information sharing. Company wikis require active maintenance and clarity to serve their intended purpose.

**Videos Over Text, Any Day:**

Asynchronous video updates enable complex information sharing in engaging formats beyond text alone. Team members can view and respond according to their schedules, adding personal connection to remote interactions.

**Coffee Breaks, But Make Them Virtual:**

The Swedish concept of FIKA—taking breaks for coffee and conversation—promotes well-being and social connection. Virtual coffee breaks facilitate personal connection and non-work discussions, replacing traditional watercooler moments while enhancing team cohesion and creative thinking.

**Face Time Matters Too:**

In-person gatherings, whether strategic offsites or informal meetups, strengthen relationships and foster collaboration. These opportunities enrich the remote work experience through direct team interaction.

## Wrapping Up: The Remote Work Journey

The right organizational culture significantly impacts remote work effectiveness, creating meaningful benefits for all involved. Remote work also shifts how we measure professional worth, from hours logged to [value creation](/insights/the-new-yardstick-value-creation-over-hours-worked/).
