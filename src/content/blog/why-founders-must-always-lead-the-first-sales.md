A number of founders have asked me recently for help with making their first sales, typically asking:

1. How to commercialize their product?; or
2. Who should be their first customers, and how do they approach them?

I have always advised them against outsourcing sales this early on.

Why? Simply put, no one can champion your product better than you, the founder. Also early sales are a goldmine for direct customer feedback, founders should stay close to sales as long as humanly possible for this reason alone.

So why are Founders the best initial sales leads?

**The Authenticity of a Founder's Pitch**

As a founder, you're not just knowledgeable about your product; you're its heart and soul. You've toiled over it, you've faced challenges head-on, and more importantly, you understand the problem you're solving inside out.

1. **Passion**: A founders pitch resonates with genuine passion. When founders speak about their product, the enthusiasm is palpable. That raw energy is near impossible to replicate.

2. **Knowledge**: Founders have an intimate understanding of their product, equipping them to handle any question or concern prospective customers might have.

3. **Problem Insight**: More than knowing their product, founders grasp the problem at its core. This deep comprehension of customer pain points and needs is a game-changer during sales processes.

**When to Seek External Expertise**

Now, this doesn't mean you have to be the salesperson forever (in fact you can definitely stay too long!). The magic moment arrives when your startup's product has gained enough validation, signalling the need for scaling. That's when you might need someone like me, a [fractional VP of Sales](/insights/what-is-a-fractional-vp-sales/).

This phase allows founders to shift their focus to bigger strategic goals. Meanwhile, a seasoned salesperson can harness the momentum generated by the founder, building a scalable, efficient sales operation.

To all the founders out there, remember this: your early sales journey is an adventure, a learning experience, and an opportunity to connect deeply with your first customers. Enjoy it.
