"The appeal to clients is not just the product or service—which may still be in development—but the founder's passion, expertise, and commitment to the vision."

As traction builds and customers arrive, companies develop basic sales strategies and expand their teams. Early hires typically wear multiple hats in lead generation or customer success roles.
