## The Problem

If you're new to the concept, start with [what a fractional VP of Sales actually is](/insights/what-is-a-fractional-vp-sales/). Below are ten reasons companies should consider hiring fractional sales and GTM leadership:

**Cost and Experience Gap**: "You need sales and GTM experience but just found out how much full-time tech salespeople get paid." This addresses the financial reality of hiring experienced talent.

**Building Scalable Systems**: Organizations with initial market validation need to transition from ad-hoc sales to "a repeatable, scaleable sales engine."

**Burn Rate Management**: In current economic conditions, controlling spending has become critical for survival.

**Time and Bandwidth**: Fractional leaders provide both expertise and dedicated hours focused on revenue generation.

**Market Expansion**: New products or markets require GTM strategy development, ICP definition, channel setup, and sales motion establishment.

**Revenue Optimization**: Converting struggling pipelines requires expert diagnosis of underlying issues.

**Speed of Leadership**: Hiring permanent heads of sales typically requires six months; fractional arrangements provide immediate impact.

**Coverage Needs**: Fractional models address parental leave and other temporary gaps.

**Operational Flexibility**: The model adapts to specific business requirements without long-term commitment.

**Investor Appeal**: Demonstrable sales traction strengthens fundraising narratives.

## The Solution

Fractional GTM and sales leadership addresses these challenges through a flexible, cost-effective, and immediately impactful engagement model.
