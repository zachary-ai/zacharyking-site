As we navigate our way through the evolving work landscape of the post-COVID era, it's important to reassess some of the old metrics that we've been tethered to. One such metric is the notion of hours worked. The reality, however, is that your worth as a professional is not tied to the time you put in, but rather, the value you create.

Measuring work in terms of hours is a simple and common practice, largely because it offers a straightforward, albeit flawed, indicator of effort. Effort, of course, is a critical component in the creation of value.

The formula for value creation could be perceived as follows:

**Value = Effort × Efficiency × Time**

Each element in this equation has a distinct role:

1. **Effort**: This pertains to the intensity of work an individual invests in a task. But it's important to note that raw effort alone, if not directed appropriately and efficiently, does not result in value creation.
2. **Efficiency**: This denotes how effectively an individual can convert their effort and time into results. An efficient worker is capable of creating more value in less time compared to someone less efficient.
3. **Time**: This is the duration dedicated to accomplishing a task. While time is a component of the equation, it doesn't correlate directly with value in the way that effort and efficiency do. Spending more time on a task doesn't necessarily lead to more value, particularly if the time isn't utilised efficiently.

The traditional 40-hour work week has long been the barometer of professional commitment. But should it still be?

Consider a sales rep who consistently exceeds their targets or an engineer who successfully completes a project ahead of schedule. Will their superiors be concerned if they don't clock in on time the following day? The answer is probably no. What truly counts is the value they've delivered.

This perspective becomes even more poignant when considering entrepreneurship and product ownership. These roles enable you to generate revenue that isn't tied directly to your input of time. Instead of trading time for money, you're leveraging your skills, knowledge, and innovation to create value that goes beyond the hours you log in.

This is the ultimate goal: decoupling income from personal effort. When you can create a product, service, or system that continues to generate value—and income—irrespective of the hours you put in, you've achieved something truly remarkable.

This is where the role of a Fractional Executive, such as a [Fractional VP of Sales](/insights/what-is-a-fractional-vp-sales/), becomes pivotal. A Fractional Executive challenges the traditional formula by leveraging a minimal amount of time to yield maximum value. With years of experience under their belt, a Fractional Exec's efficiency quotient is significantly higher than that of a less experienced worker. This wealth of experience enables them to handle situations in the most efficient manner possible, usually because they've already explored various alternative approaches in the past.

If you're looking to truly maximise your value output, consider harnessing the power of a Fractional Executive. This is also why [fractional executives surpass traditional consultants](/insights/the-results-driven-approach-why-fractional-executives-surpass-consultants/), they're measured on outcomes, not deliverables. After all, it's value, not hours, that is the real measure of work.
